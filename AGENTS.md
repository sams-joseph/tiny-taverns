# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Layout, commands, and how to run each app are documented in `README.md` — start there.
- **Vite/Vitest versions must stay aligned.** Vitest 2 pulls Vite 5 while `@vitejs/plugin-react`
  uses Vite 6; mixing them produces duplicate-`vite` type errors. The workspace pins Vitest 3 +
  Vite 6 together across `apps/web` and `packages/ui`. Keep them in lockstep when bumping.
- **`@taverns/tsconfig` exposes each base via an `exports` map** (not just `files`). This is what
  lets esbuild (Vite/Vitest) resolve the nested `extends` chain without warnings — don't drop it.
- `packages/ui` ships TypeScript source (`exports` → `./src/index.ts`); Vite transpiles it directly
  as a workspace package. Its `build` only emits `.d.ts`.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
